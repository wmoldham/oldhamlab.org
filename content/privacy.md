Our website uses "cookies" set by Google Analytics. Cookies are small data files that online services can store on, and retrieve from, a user's computer or mobile device through the user's web browser. 

Most internet browsers accept cookies by default, but you can [modify your browser preferences](https://www.howtogeek.com/63721/how-to-block-all-cookies-except-for-websites-you-use/) to block or restrict cookies if you do not want your web browsing activity tracked. There are a variety of tools publicly available to manage cookies and similar technologies that collect information related to your use of our website.

We are not responsible for the effectiveness or compliance of third party opt-out mechanisms or programs.
