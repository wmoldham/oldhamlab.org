abstract: "To determine whether low ventricular filling pressures are a clinically relevant etiology of unexplained dyspnea on exertion, a database of 619 consecutive, clinically indicated invasive cardiopulmonary exercise tests (iCPETs) was reviewed to identify patients with low maximum aerobic capacity (VO<sub>2</sub>max) due to inadequate peak cardiac output (Q<sub>t</sub>max) with normal biventricular ejection fractions and without pulmonary hypertension (impaired: n = 49, VO<sub>2</sub>max = 53% predicted [interquartile range (IQR): 47%-64%], Q<sub>t</sub>max = 72% predicted [62%-76%]). These were compared to patients with a normal exercise response (normal: n = 28, VO<sub>2</sub>max = 86% predicted [84%-97%], Q<sub>t</sub>max = 108% predicted [97%-115%]). Before exercise, all patients received up to 2 L of intravenous normal saline to target an upright pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) of $>$/=5 mmHg. Despite this treatment, biventricular filling pressures at peak exercise were lower in the impaired group than in the normal group (right atrial pressure [RAP]: 6 [IQR: 5-8] vs. 9 [7-10] mmHg, P = 0.004; PCWP: 12 [10-16] vs. 17 [14-19] mmHg, P $<$ 0.001), associated with decreased stroke volume (SV) augmentation with exercise (+13 ± 10 [standard deviation (SD)] vs. +18 ± 10 mL/m(2), P = 0.014). A review of hemodynamic data from 23 patients with low RAP on an initial iCPET who underwent a second iCPET after saline infusion (2.0 ± 0.5 L) demonstrated that 16 of 23 patients responded with increases in Q<sub>t</sub>max ([+24% predicted [IQR: 14%-34%]), VO<sub>2</sub>max (+10% predicted [7%-12%]), and maximum SV (+26% ± 17% [SD]). These data suggest that inadequate ventricular filling related to low venous pressure is a clinically relevant cause of exercise intolerance."
