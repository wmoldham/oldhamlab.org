abstract: "There has been tremendous and rapidly growing interest in understanding intermediary metabolism as a key aspect of both normal cellular function and as a participant in the molecular pathogenesis of many different complex diseases. This area of research naturally intersects at virtually every level with the substantial and expanding body of knowledge regarding mechanisms of cellular redox balance. In this Forum, the contributing authors address specifically the union of intermediary metabolism and redox biology through detailed consideration of the biochemistry and biology of nicotine adenine dinucleotides, the cell's \"redox currency.\" From technical considerations of how to measure nicotine adenine dinucleotides all the way to detailed treatments of their potential roles in specific disease states, this Forum provides a thorough introduction to a topic that is positioned to be at the heart of the next wave of research in metabolism and redox biology. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 28, 165-166."
