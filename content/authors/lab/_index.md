The Oldham Lab in [Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine Division](https://www.brighamandwomens.org/medicine/pulmonary-and-critical-care-medicine) and [Department of Medicine](https://www.brighamandwomens.org/department-of-medicine) at [Brigham and Women's Hospital](https://www.brighamandwomens.org/) and [Harvard Medical School](https://hms.harvard.edu/) studies cellular metabolic responses to hypoxia and the metabolic pathobiology of pulmonary vascular disease. We have expertise in state-of-the-art approaches in the field including metabolomics, stable isotope tracing, extracellular flux analyses, and network medicine applied to experimental systems ranging from protein biochemistry to clinical studies.
